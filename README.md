# hybrid: Hybrid Approximation Algorithm for Marginal Likelihood Estimation

`hybrid` is an R package computing the marginal likelihood based on the hybrid approximation methodology (Chuu et. al., 2021).

We provide the implementation for the following:
(1) vanilla hybrid approximation
(2)  hybrid-ep approximation 

## Installation

Currently, this package is available to be built locally in R. 

## Using the package in practice

See [this demo](https://github.com/echuu/hybrid/blob/main/examples/demo/demo.pdf) for an illustration of how to use this package in practice. The source code for this example can be found [here](https://github.com/echuu/hybrid/blob/main/examples/demo/demo.Rmd).
